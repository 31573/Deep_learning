Overview:
The Alphabet Soup Charity Prediction Project aims to develop a machine learning model to predict the success of organizations funded by Alphabet Soup based on various features provided in the dataset. The project utilizes deep learning techniques to create a binary classification model that determines whether the funding provided by Alphabet Soup was used effectively by the recipient organizations.
Project Structure:
•	Data Preprocessing: In this phase, the dataset is preprocessed to handle missing values, encode categorical variables, and split the data into training and testing sets.
•	Model Compilation, Training, and Evaluation: A neural network model is designed, compiled, trained, and evaluated using TensorFlow and Keras. The model's performance metrics, such as loss and accuracy, are assessed on the test data.
•	Model Optimization: Various optimization techniques are explored to enhance the model's predictive accuracy, including adjusting input data, modifying neural network architecture, and experimenting with different training parameters.
•	Report: A detailed analysis report is provided, summarizing the project's objectives, methodology, results, and recommendations for future improvements.
Files Included:
•	charity_data.csv: The dataset containing metadata about organizations funded by Alphabet Soup.
•	AlphabetSoupCharity.ipynb: Jupyter Notebook containing the code for data preprocessing, model compilation, training, and evaluation.
•	AlphabetSoupCharity_Optimization.ipynb: Jupyter Notebook for optimizing the model to achieve higher predictive accuracy.
•	AlphabetSoupCharity.h5: HDF5 file containing the trained neural network model.
•	AlphabetSoupCharity_Optimization.h5: HDF5 file containing the optimized neural network model.
•	README.md: This README file providing an overview of the project and its components.
